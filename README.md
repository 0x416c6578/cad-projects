# CAD Projects
A collection of random CAD stuff, might be useful to some people. Designs are created for my Ender-3 Pro 3D printer.

## Description of Files
- `Flashcard Box.fcstd` is a simple box for storing small flashcards I use to learn Mandarin characters. It is designed for flashcards about 40*45mm. It was one of the first things I designed in FreeCAD for my 3D printer
- `Mic Case.fcstd` is a small case for the Samson Go-Mic USB. In the future I plan to add some mounting mechanism to the back for a printable stand
- `PiCam Mount.fcstd` is a simple mount for a Raspberry Pi camera that screws into the left hand base extrusion of the Ender-3 Pro. Currently I just zip-tie the camera to it but I plan to make a printable mount that will screw on, which you can use to change the pose of the camera
- `FlexLink End Cap.fcstd` is a simple end cap for RS FlexLink 44mm aluminium extrusion (which I am currently using for my individual project at university)

## Other
- To print, focus on the `Body` element in the FreeCAD *part* pane on the left, then File->Export to `stl` which can be sliced and printed
